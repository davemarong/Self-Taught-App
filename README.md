### Technologies I used in this project

Technologies used in this project:

- React : SelfTaught is a reusable component based application, which makes React the perfect choice.

- Redux : I wanted to have the opportunity to further develop this app in the future if I want to. With Redux, I get a much more easier codebase to re visit in the future, because Redux is by default more organized and structured than using Context for state management. I do use local state (useState) as well, for states values that are very specific and only will be used once.

- Material UI : Is a very fast and easy to implement, especially grid. I also use some CSS for specific tasks.

- Framer Motion : Framer Motion is compatible with Material UI, which makes it a powerful combination.

- Swiper : A tool i used for creating swiping animation for the instructions videos.

- Strapi : Using Strapi for user authentication and storing all user data. It is also easy to implement with Heroku.

- Heroku : Hosting service that goes well with Strapi.

- Netlify : With the continuous and automatic deployment when pushing to GitHub, is makes everything so easy.

- Git: I use the command line (and the GitHub CLI tool) for most of the Git work, while using GitKraken if I need to visually interface of my git history.
